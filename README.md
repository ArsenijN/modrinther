# modrinther
Simple tool that fixes and parses `.mrpack`, regardless on broken CRCs

# About
**`modrinther`** - powerfull tool if your `Just Some Mods` don't want to install because of one or more broken CRC in **`.mrpack`**. Thing touched me, so I created modrinther.

# Usage
Just drag'n'drop `.mrpack` file on executable and see the magic~

Also, CLI supported (so why CLI wouldn't be supported if drag'n'drop are?)

# Compatibility
modrinther at least compatible with next `.mrpack`s:
- **Just Some Mods**
